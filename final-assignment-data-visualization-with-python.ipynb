Create visualizations using Matplotib, Seaborn and Folium
Estimated time needed: 40 minutes

In this assignment, you will have the opportunity to demonstrate the skills you have acquired in creating visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn, Folium.

After each task you will be required to save your plots as an image or screenshot using the filenames specified. You will be uploading these images during your final project submission so they can be evaluated by your peers.

Installing Required Libraries
The following required libraries are pre-installed in the Skills Network Labs environment. However, if you run these notebook commands in a different Jupyter environment (e.g. Watson Studio or Ananconda), you will need to install these libraries by removing the # sign before %pip in the code cell below.

# All Libraries required for this lab are listed below. The libraries pre-installed on Skills Network Labs are commented.
# %pip install -qy pandas==1.3.4 numpy==1.21.4 matplotlib==3.5.0 seaborn folium
# Note: If your environment doesn't support "%pip install", use "!mamba install"

Scenario
In this assignment you will be tasked with creating plots which answer questions for analysing "historical_automobile_sales" data to understand the historical trends in automobile sales during recession periods.
recession period 1 - year 1980
recession period 2 - year 1981 to 1982
recession period 3 - year 1991
recession period 4 - year 2000 to 2001
recession period 5 - year end 2007 to mid 2009
recession period 6 - year 2020 -Feb to April (Covid-19 Impact)

Data Description
The dataset used for this visualization assignment contains historical_automobile_sales data representing automobile sales and related variables during recession and non-recession period.

The dataset includes the following variables:
1. Date: The date of the observation.
2. Recession: A binary variable indicating recession perion; 1 means it was recession, 0 means it was normal.
3. Automobile_Sales: The number of vehicles sold during the period.
4. GDP: The per capita GDP value in USD.
5. Unemployment_Rate: The monthly unemployment rate.
6. Consumer_Confidence: A synthetic index representing consumer confidence, which can impact consumer spending and automobile purchases.
7. Seasonality_Weight: The weight representing the seasonality effect on automobile sales during the period.
8. Price: The average vehicle price during the period.
9. Advertising_Expenditure: The advertising expenditure of the company.
10.Vehicle_Type: The type of vehicles sold; Supperminicar, Smallfamiliycar, Mediumfamilycar, Executivecar, Sports.
11.Competition: The measure of competition in the market, such as the number of competitors or market share of major manufacturers.
12.Month: Month of the observation extracted from Date..
13.Year: Year of the observation extracted from Date.
By examining various factors mentioned above from the dataset, you aim to gain insights into how recessions impacted automobile sales for your company.

From the above chart what insights have you gained on the overall sales of automobiles during recession?
Type your answer below:-
add Codeadd Markdown
During Recession period the sales in average are great than No recession period. The Volume sales are slightly different between them but meddium family cars are the most sold in this period, in contrast the supperminni cars are less sold. of No Recession period are greater. In other hand during no recession period the majority types of vehicles have similar volume sales but SpÃ³rts type has "considerible" less volume sales than the others in this case.
